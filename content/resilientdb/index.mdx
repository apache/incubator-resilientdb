# Overview

ResilientDB (incubator-resilientdb) is a **fault-tolerant** distributed database system.
It uses multiple server copies (_replicas_) that communicate over a network to agree on the correct order of operations (transactions).
This agreement process, called **consensus** (often using PBFT), ensures that the database remains _consistent and available_ even if some replicas crash or behave incorrectly.
External applications interact with the database through **client libraries** to store and retrieve data reliably.
