## About

ResVault is a chrome extension that serves as a wallet for [ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com). ResilientDB is a High Throughput Yielding Permissioned Blockchain Fabric founded by [ExpoLab](https://expolab.org/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2018. ResilientDB advocates a system-centric design by adopting a multi-threaded architecture that encompasses deep pipelines. Further, ResilientDB separates the ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows it to process messages out-of-order.
