# Change Log

### NexRes v1.9.0 ([2023-11-29](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.9.0))

Support Multi-version Key-Value Interface. ([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen))

* Get and Set need to provide a version number to fetch the correct version of the data (if exists) or write to the correct version of data (if not overwritten already), respectively.
* Provide interfaces to obtain historical data with a specific version or a range of versions.


### NexRes v1.8.0 ([2023-08-21](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.8.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** The view-change recovery protocol was extensively expanded to support the following Byzantine failures through primary/leader replacement and replica recovery. ([Dakai Kang](https://github.com/DakaiKang))

* Byzantine primary becomes non-responsive, stopping proposing any new Pre-Prepare messages.
* Byzantine primary equivocates, proposing two different client requests to two subsets of replicas.
* Byzantine replicas try to keep some non-faulty replicas in the dark.
* Byzantine new primary becomes non-responsive, refusing to broadcast New-View messages.

### NexRes v1.7.0 ([2023-08-04](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.7.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** For each replica local recovery from durable storage upon system restart was added.([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen))


### NexRes v1.6.0 ([2023-05-30](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.6.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** Refactoring and enhancement of the codebase to highlight the entire software stack of ResilientDB consisting of the following layers ([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen))

* SDK Layer (C++, Python, Go, Solidity)
* Interface Layer (key-value, smart contract, UTXO)
* ResilientDB Database Connectivity (RDBC) API
* Platform Layer (consensus, chain, network, notary)

### NexRes v1.5.0 ([2023-04-04](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.5.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** 
* A complete refactoring of the codebase such that (1) the core engine code is now moved to the platform folder, including the formwork architectures and protocols implementations; (2) the API/interface-related code is moved to the service folder, including UTXO, smart contract, and key-value interface;  (3) the python SDK code is moved to a different repository [here](https://github.com/resilientdb/sdk) ([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen)).

### NexRes v1.4.0 ([2023-02-28](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v.1.4.0))

**Fixed Bugs:**
* Fixed KV service queries on all values retrieving empty placeholder values ([Glenn Chen](https://github.com/glenn-chen))

### NexRes v1.2.0 ([2023-01-29](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.2.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** 
* Support smart contract compiled from Solidity. ([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen))

### NexRes v1.1.0 ([2023-01-03](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.1.0))

**Implemented Enhancements:** 

* Added Geo-Scale Byzantine Fault-tolerant consensus protocol, referred to as GeoBFT. It is designed for excellent scalability by using a topological-aware grouping of replicas in local clusters, giving rise to parallelization of consensus at the local level and by minimizing communication between clusters. ([WayneWang](https://github.com/WayneJa))
