#  Configuring the Apollo Client cache 

Ask AI a question about this page

Ask with ChatGPT

Ask with ClaudeAsk with ChatGPT

* * *

This article describes cache setup and configuration. To learn how to interact with cached data, see [Reading and writing data to the cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction).

## Initialization

Create an `InMemoryCache` object and provide it to the `ApolloClient` constructor, like so:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1import { InMemoryCache, ApolloClient } from "@apollo/client";
    2
    3const client = new ApolloClient({
    4  // ...other arguments...
    5  cache: new InMemoryCache(options),
    6});

The `InMemoryCache` constructor accepts a variety of [configuration options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#configuration-options).

## Configuration options

You can configure the cache's behavior to better suit your application. For example, you can:

  * Customize the format of a particular type's [cache ID](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#customizing-cache-ids)

  * Customize the storage and retrieval of [individual fields](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/)

  * Define polymorphic type relationships for [fragment matching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#possibletypes)

  * Define patterns for [pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/overview/)

  * Manage client-side [local state](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/local-state-management/)




To customize cache behavior, you provide a configuration object to the `InMemoryCache` constructor. This object supports the following fields:

Name /  
Type | Description  
---|---  
  
###### `resultCaching`

`Boolean`| If `true`, the cache returns an identical (`===`) response object for every execution of the same query, as long as the underlying data remains unchanged. This helps you detect changes to a query's result.The default value is `true`.  
  
###### `resultCacheMaxSize`

`number`| The limit of the number of result objects that will be retained in memory to speed up repeated reads to the cache.The default value is `Math.pow(2, 16)`.  
  
###### `possibleTypes`

`Object`| Include this object to define polymorphic relationships between your schema's types. Doing so enables you to look up cached data by interface or by union.Each key in the object is the `__typename` of an interface or union, and the corresponding value is an array of the `__typename`s of the types that belong to that union or implement that interface.For an example, see [Defining `possibleTypes` manually](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#defining-possibletypes-manually).  
  
###### `typePolicies`

`Object`| Include this object to customize the cache's behavior on a type-by-type basis.Each key in the object is the `__typename` of a type to customize, and the corresponding value is a [`TypePolicy` object](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#typepolicy-fields).  
  
###### `dataIdFromObject`

`Function`| A function that takes a response object and returns a unique identifier to be used when normalizing the data in the store.For details, see [Customizing identifier generation globally](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#customizing-identifier-generation-globally).  
  
## Customizing cache IDs

You can customize how the `InMemoryCache` generates cache IDs for individual types in your schema ([see the default behavior](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/overview/#2-generate-cache-ids)). This is helpful especially if a type uses a field (or fields!) _besides_ `id` or `_id` as its unique identifier.

To accomplish this, you define a `TypePolicy` for each type you want to customize. You specify all of your cache's `typePolicies` in [the `options` object you provide to the `InMemoryCache` constructor](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#configuration-options).

Include a `keyFields` field in relevant `TypePolicy` objects, like so:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1const cache = new InMemoryCache({
    2  typePolicies: {
    3    Product: {
    4      // In an inventory management system, products might be identified
    5      // by their UPC.
    6      keyFields: ["upc"],
    7    },
    8    Person: {
    9      // In a user account system, the combination of a person's name AND email
    10      // address might uniquely identify them.
    11      keyFields: ["name", "email"],
    12    },
    13    Book: {
    14      // If one of the keyFields is an object with fields of its own, you can
    15      // include those nested keyFields by using a nested array of strings:
    16      keyFields: ["title", "author", ["name"]],
    17    },
    18    AllProducts: {
    19      // Singleton types that have no identifying field can use an empty
    20      // array for their keyFields.
    21      keyFields: [],
    22    },
    23    Store: {
    24      // If you need to disable normalization, set the keyFields to false
    25      // and the object will be embedded in the parent
    26      keyFields: false,
    27    },
    28    Location: {
    29      // You can also use a function to determine any of the values above.
    30      // The first argument is the reference to the record to be written, and the second is the runtime context
    31      keyFields: (location, context) => {
    32        if (context.readField("state")) {
    33          return ["city", "state", "country"];
    34        } else {
    35          return ["city", "country"];
    36        }
    37      },
    38    },
    39  },
    40});

This example shows a variety of `typePolicies` with different `keyFields`:

  * The `Product` type uses its `upc` field as its identifying field.

  * The `Person` type uses the combination of both its `name` _and_ `email` fields.

  * The `Book` type includes a _sub field_ as part of its cache ID.

    * The `["name"]` item indicates that the `name` field of the _previous_ field in the array (`author`) is part of the cache ID. The `Book`'s `author` field must be an object that includes a `name` field for this to be valid.

    * A valid cache ID for the `Book` type has the following structure:

Text

copy
          
          1Book:{"title":"Fahrenheit 451","author":{"name":"Ray Bradbury"}}

  * The `AllProducts` type illustrates a special strategy for a **singleton** type. If the cache will only ever contain one `AllProducts` object and that object has _no_ identifying fields, you can provide an empty array for its `keyFields`.

  * The `Store` type provides an example of how you can [disable normalization](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#disabling-normalization) by setting the keyFields to `false`

  * The `Location` type provides an example of using custom function given object and runtime context to calculate what fields should be used for the key field selection.

    * Keep in mind that the first argument here is a reference to the record that will be written. As such, it does NOT include subselected fields, only scalar fields, and it contains aliases from the operation. If you need to read the real type you can use `context.storeObject`. To read even more indepth about how this function can work the best source will be our own [test cases for the cache policies](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/8bc7d4d406402962bf5151cdd2c5c75c9398d10c/src/cache/inmemory/__tests__/policies.ts#L5543-L5622)




If an object has multiple `keyFields`, the cache ID always lists those fields in the same order to ensure uniqueness.

Note that these `keyFields` strings always refer to the canonical field names defined in the schema. This means that ID computation is _not_ sensitive to field aliases.

### Calculating an object's cache ID

If you define a custom cache ID that uses multiple fields, it can be challenging to calculate and provide that ID to methods that require it (such as `cache.readFragment`).

To help with this, you can use the `cache.identify` method to calculate the cache ID for any normalized object you fetch from your cache. See [Obtaining an object's custom ID](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/#obtaining-an-objects-cache-id).

### Customizing identifier generation globally

If you need to define a single fallback `keyFields` function that isn't specific to any particular `__typename`, you can use the `dataIdFromObject` function that was introduced in Apollo Client 2.x:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1import { defaultDataIdFromObject } from "@apollo/client";
    2
    3const cache = new InMemoryCache({
    4  dataIdFromObject(responseObject) {
    5    switch (responseObject.__typename) {
    6      case "Product":
    7        return `Product:${responseObject.upc}`;
    8      case "Person":
    9        return `Person:${responseObject.name}:${responseObject.email}`;
    10      default:
    11        return defaultDataIdFromObject(responseObject);
    12    }
    13  },
    14});

> The `dataIdFromObject` API is included in Apollo Client 3 to ease the transition from Apollo Client 2.x.

Notice that the above function still uses different logic to generate keys based on an object's `__typename`. In a case like this, you should almost always define `keyFields` arrays for the `Product` and `Person` types via `typePolicies`.

This code also has the following drawbacks:

  * It's sensitive to aliasing mistakes.

  * It does nothing to protect against undefined object properties.

  * Accidentally using different key fields at different times can cause inconsistencies in the cache.




### Customizing Type Policies

After creating an `InMemoryCache` instance, you can use the `addTypePolicies` method to add or modify type policies.

Here is an example of how to use the `addTypePolicies` method:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1const cache = new InMemoryCache({
    2  typePolicies: {
    3    Person: {
    4      fields: {
    5        name: {
    6          read(name = "UNKNOWN NAME") {
    7            return name.toUpperCase();
    8          },
    9        },
    10      },
    11    },
    12  },
    13});
    14
    15// Add a type policy to the cache.
    16cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    17  Person: {
    18    fields: {
    19      email: {
    20        read(email = "unknown@example.com") {
    21          return email;
    22        },
    23      },
    24    },
    25  },
    26});

The code creates an `InMemoryCache` with a custom type policy for the `Person` type. The type policy specifies that if the `name` field is not available in the cache, it should return a default value of "UNKNOWN NAME" and converts it to uppercase.

Then, the code adds an additional type policy to the cache using `cache.policies.addTypePolicies`. This new type policy is related to the `Person` type and its `email` field. The custom read function specifies that if the email field is not available in the cache, it should return a default value of "[unknown@example.com](mailto:unknown@example.com)".

Overall, the code sets up caching behaviors for the `Person` type, ensuring that default values are provided for the `name` and `email` fields if they are not present in the cache.

### Disabling normalization

You can instruct the `InMemoryCache` _not_ to normalize objects of a particular type. This can be useful for metrics and other transient data that's identified by a timestamp and never receives updates.

To disable normalization for a type, define a `TypePolicy` for the type (as shown in [Customizing cache IDs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#customizing-cache-ids)) and set the policy's `keyFields` field to `false`.

Objects that are not normalized are instead embedded within their _parent_ object in the cache. You can't access these objects directly, but you can access them via their parent.

## `TypePolicy` fields

To customize how the cache interacts with specific types in your schema, you can pass the `InMemoryCache` constructor an object that maps `__typename` strings to `TypePolicy` objects.

A `TypePolicy` object can include the following fields:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1type TypePolicy = {
    2  // Allows defining the primary key fields for this type, either using an
    3  // array of field names, a function that returns an arbitrary string, or
    4  // false to disable normalization for objects of this type.
    5  keyFields?: KeySpecifier | KeyFieldsFunction | false;
    6
    7  // If your schema uses a custom __typename for any of the root Query,
    8  // Mutation, and/or Subscription types (rare), set the corresponding
    9  // field below to true to indicate that this type serves as that type.
    10  queryType?: true;
    11  mutationType?: true;
    12  subscriptionType?: true;
    13
    14  fields?: {
    15    [fieldName: string]:
    16      | FieldPolicy<StoreValue>
    17      | FieldReadFunction<StoreValue>;
    18  };
    19};
    20
    21// Recursive type aliases are coming in TypeScript 3.7, so this isn't the
    22// actual type we use, but it's what it should be:
    23type KeySpecifier = (string | KeySpecifier)[];
    24
    25type KeyFieldsFunction = (
    26  object: Readonly<StoreObject>,
    27  context: {
    28    typename: string;
    29    selectionSet?: SelectionSetNode;
    30    fragmentMap?: FragmentMap;
    31  }
    32) => string | null | void;

### Overriding root operation types (uncommon)

In addition to `keyFields`, a `TypePolicy` can indicate that its type represents the root query, mutation, or subscription type by setting `queryType`, `mutationType`, or `subscriptionType` to `true`:

TypeScript

copy
    
    
    1const cache = new InMemoryCache({
    2  typePolicies: {
    3    UnconventionalRootQuery: {
    4      // The RootQueryFragment can only match if the cache knows the __typename
    5      // of the root query object.
    6      queryType: true,
    7    },
    8  },
    9});
    10
    11const result = cache.readQuery({
    12  query: gql`
    13    query MyQuery {
    14      ...RootQueryFragment
    15    }
    16    fragment RootQueryFragment on UnconventionalRootQuery {
    17      field1
    18      field2 {
    19        subfield
    20      }
    21    }
    22  `,
    23});
    24
    25const equivalentResult = cache.readQuery({
    26  query: gql`
    27    query MyQuery {
    28      field1
    29      field2 {
    30        subfield
    31      }
    32    }
    33  `,
    34});

The cache usually obtains `__typename` information by adding the `__typename` field to every query selection set it sends to the server. It could technically use this same method for the outermost selection set of every operation, but the `__typename`s of the root query and mutation are almost always `"Query"` and `"Mutation"`, so the cache assumes those common defaults unless instructed otherwise in a `TypePolicy`.

For most objects in a graph, the `__typename` field is vital for proper identification and normalization. For the root query and mutation types, the `__typename` is not nearly as useful or important, because those types are singletons with only one instance per client.

### The `fields` property

The final property within `TypePolicy` is the `fields` property, which enables you to [customize the behavior of individual cached fields](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior).
